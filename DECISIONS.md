## Quick Reference: Traps to Avoid

| Trap | Problem | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| React state in callbacks | State closure captures stale value | Use `useRef` for values needed in async callbacks |
| Times before truck arrival | Dispatcher asks for impossible times | Always use `actualArrival = original + delay` as baseline |
| Confirmed time on extraction | UI shows "confirmed" before acceptance | Only set confirmed state when `shouldAccept: true` |
| VAPI model-output events | Looks like duplicate messages | These are internal LLM events, not spoken output - ignore them |
| Hardcoded OTIF assumptions | Wrong thresholds for different contracts | Use cost curve analysis to detect penalty structure |
| PDF parsing libraries | Complex setup, poor layout handling | Claude processes PDFs natively via `document` content type |
| Silence timer too short | Call ends mid-sentence | Wait for `speech-end` event THEN start silence timer |

---

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Claude Native PDF Processing

**Decision:** Use Claude's native PDF processing instead of `pdf-parse` or similar libraries.

**Context:**
- Phase 7 required extracting contract terms from PDF documents
- Initial plan was to use `pdf-parse` npm package

**Why This Approach:**
- Claude can process PDFs natively via the `document` content type in the API
- Claude's PDF understanding handles complex layouts, tables, and formatting better
- No additional dependencies to maintain
- More sophisticated extraction than text-only parsing

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In /lib/google-drive.ts
// Return PDF as base64 - Claude handles it directly
if (mimeType === 'application/pdf') {
  return { content: base64Content, contentType: 'pdf' };
}
```

---

### AD-2: Cost Curve Analysis Algorithm

**Decision:** Dynamically detect penalty structure by sampling costs instead of hardcoding assumptions.

**Context:**
- Original code assumed specific OTIF/dwell time rules
- Different contracts have different penalty structures
- Strategy thresholds were wrong for non-Walmart contracts

**Why This Approach:**
```
Before: Hardcoded OTIF/dwell assumptions
After:  Sample costs every 15 min → detect penalty structure → set thresholds
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate actual arrival time (`origMins + delayMinutes`)
2. Sample costs every 15 minutes for 6 hours after arrival
3. Analyze the cost curve to detect:
   - Flat zones (no penalty increase)
   - Step jumps (sudden $100+ increases)
   - Linear growth (gradual increases)
4. Set thresholds dynamically based on detected structure

**Key Achievement:** System is now truly GENERIC - works with any contract penalty structure without hardcoded assumptions.

**Files:** `/lib/negotiation-strategy.ts` - `analyzeCostCurve()` function

---

### AD-3: Modular Architecture (Hooks + Utilities)

**Decision:** Completely separate business logic from UI presentation.

**Context:**
- Two UI variants needed (`/dispatch` and `/dispatch-2`)
- Bug fixes were being made in one place but not the other
- Risk of inconsistent behavior between pages

**Why This Approach:**
```
Before Modularization:
/app/dispatch/page.tsx        ❌ Change here
/app/dispatch-2/page.tsx      ❌ AND here
(Risk: Forget one = inconsistent behavior)

After Modularization:
/lib/text-mode-handlers.ts    ✅ Change ONCE
Both pages automatically updated!
```

**Structure:**
| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Hooks | `/hooks/` | Reusable state logic |
| Utilities | `/lib/` | Pure functions |
| Types | `/types/` | Shared interfaces |
| APIs | `/app/api/` | Backend endpoints |
| Components | `/components/dispatch*/` | UI only (2 variants) |

**Benefit:** Fix bugs once, both UI variants updated automatically.

### AD-4: Google Drive Service Account Auth

**Decision:** Use service account authentication (server-side) instead of OAuth flow.

**Context:**
- Need to fetch contracts from Google Drive
- OAuth would require user login flow
- Contracts are in a shared company folder

**Why This Approach:**
- Server-side only - no client credentials exposed
- No user interaction required
- Works with shared folders
- Simpler implementation

**Files:** `/lib/google-drive.ts`

---

### AD-5: No Database (Stateless)

**Decision:** Keep the application stateless with no database.

**Context:**
- Initial design consideration for storing contracts/agreements

**Why This Approach:**
- Contracts fetched fresh from Google Drive each time
- Agreements saved to Google Sheets (external storage)
- Simpler deployment (no DB provisioning)
- No stale data issues

**Trade-off:** ~30-40 seconds to analyze contract on each workflow start.

---

### AD-6: Walmart as Fallback Retailer

**Decision:** Use 'Walmart' as the fallback party name until contract extraction provides the real value.

**Context:**
- Removed hardcoded retailer dropdown in Phase 7.5
- Cost engine still needs a retailer for legacy `DEFAULT_CONTRACT_RULES`

**Why 'Walmart':**
- Most comprehensive penalty structure in `DEFAULT_CONTRACT_RULES`
- Conservative approach - won't under-estimate costs
- Replaced by actual extracted party name when contract analysis succeeds

**Files:** Multiple - search for `// Fallback - will be replaced by extracted party`

## Bug Fixes & Root Causes

### BUG-1: React State Closure Bug (Voice Call Auto-End)

**Symptom:** Voice call did not end automatically after collecting all information and Mike said closing phrase.

**Debug Logs Revealed:**
```
"Storing pending accepted time: 16:30 with cost: 1725" ✓
"⚠️ Got dock but no pending time! offeredDock: 1, pendingAcceptedTime: null" ✗
```

**Root Cause:**
- Used `useState` for `pendingAcceptedTime`
- State updates are asynchronous - function closure captures initial value (`null`)
- When dock was extracted later, `pendingAcceptedTime` was still `null` in the closure
- `finishNegotiation()` never called → `confirmedTimeRef/confirmedDockRef` never set
- Auto-end check failed because refs were null

**Solution:** Changed from `useState` to `useRef`
- `useRef` updates synchronously - `ref.current` immediately reflects new value
- No closure issues - always reads latest value

**Fixed Flow:**
```
1. Time extracted → pendingAcceptedTimeRef.current = '16:30' ✓
2. Dock extracted → Check pendingAcceptedTimeRef.current → Has value! ✓
3. Call finishNegotiation('16:30', '1', cost) ✓
4. Set confirmedTimeRef and confirmedDockRef ✓
5. Mike says closing phrase → Auto-end check passes ✓
6. Call ends automatically! ✓
```

**Files Modified:** `/app/dispatch/page.tsx`

**Lesson:** Use `useRef` instead of `useState` for values that need to be read in async callbacks/closures where you need the latest value.

### BUG-2: Dispatcher Asks for Times Before Truck Arrival

**Symptom:**
- 2 PM appointment + 90 min delay = 3:30 PM actual arrival
- ❌ Dispatcher asks for 2:30 PM slot (impossible - truck arrives at 3:30 PM!)
- ❌ Strategy cards show "IDEAL: Before 14:30" (before actual arrival)

**Root Cause:** All calculations used `original_appointment` instead of `original_appointment + delay_minutes`

**Impact:**
- Strategy cards showed impossible times
- Negotiation logic asked for times before truck arrives
- Cost calculations relative to wrong baseline

**Solution:** Calculate actual arrival time and use it as baseline:
```typescript
const actualArrivalMinutes = originalAppointmentMinutes + delayMinutes;
// All thresholds now relative to actualArrivalMinutes
```

**Test Results** (2 PM + 90 mins = 3:30 PM arrival, Walmart, $50K):
- ✅ **Truck arrives banner**: Shows 15:30 (3:30 PM)
- ✅ **IDEAL**: Around 15:30-16:00 (not 14:30!)
- ✅ **OK**: Before 17:15-17:30 (before step jump)
- ✅ **BAD**: After 17:30 (when dwell charges kick in)

**Files Modified:**
- `/lib/negotiation-strategy.ts` - `analyzeCostCurve()` function
- `/hooks/useCostCalculation.ts` - Returns `actualArrivalTime`
- `/components/dispatch/StrategyPanel.tsx` - Displays arrival time

---

### BUG-3: Confirmed Time Updates on Extraction (Not Acceptance)

**Symptom:** Voice mode updated `confirmedTime` when extracting warehouse offer, not when dispatcher accepts.

**Root Cause:**
- Voice mode set confirmed time/dock immediately after extraction (lines 128-135)
- Text mode already handled this correctly (only set on `evaluation.shouldAccept`)

**Solution:**
1. Changed extraction logic to use local variables instead of setting state
2. Store `offeredTime` and `offeredDock` locally, not in confirmed state
3. Only confirmed values are set when offer is actually accepted

**Fixed Behavior:**
```
Warehouse: "6 PM"
→ Extraction: {offeredTime: '18:00'} (stored in local variable)
→ Evaluation: shouldPushback = true
→ Mike: "6 PM is too late for us..." (REJECT)
→ State: confirmedTime remains null ✅

Warehouse: "3:45 PM"
→ Extraction: {offeredTime: '15:45'} (stored in local variable)
→ Evaluation: shouldAccept = true
→ finishNegotiation('15:45', 'B5', ...)
→ State: setConfirmedTime('15:45') ✅ CORRECT
```

**Files Modified:** `/app/dispatch/page.tsx`

### BUG-4: Voice Call Ends Mid-Sentence

**Symptom:** Voice call ended immediately after Mike said closing phrase, not waiting for complete speech or user response.

**Requirements:**
1. Mike must completely finish speaking the closing message
2. Wait for a few seconds of silence before closing the call
3. If warehouse manager speaks during silence period, continue conversation
4. After resolving their query, Mike says another closing phrase and cycle repeats

**Solution:**

1. **Track Assistant Speech State:**
   - Added `speech-update` event listener
   - Track when assistant starts/stops speaking

2. **Wait for Speech to Finish:**
   - Added `waitingForSpeechEndRef` and `isAssistantSpeakingRef`
   - `handleAssistantSpeechStart()` - cancels silence timer
   - `handleAssistantSpeechEnd()` - starts silence timer

3. **Silence Timer Logic:**
   - `startSilenceTimer()` - 5-second countdown after speech completes
   - If user speaks during silence → timer cancelled, conversation continues
   - If silence period completes → call ends gracefully

**Flow:**
```
1. Mike says closing phrase ("Alright, we'll see you then...")
2. System waits for Mike to finish speaking completely
3. 5-second silence timer starts
4. If user speaks during silence:
   → Timer cancelled
   → Mike addresses their query
   → Mike says new closing phrase
   → Back to step 2
5. If 5 seconds of silence pass:
   → Call ends gracefully
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/dispatch/page.tsx` - Silence timer logic, speech state tracking
- `/components/dispatch/VoiceCallInterface.tsx` - Speech state events
- `/types/vapi.ts` - Added `speech-update` to event types

---

### BUG-5: Warehouse Contact Not Saving to Sheets

**Symptom:** Warehouse manager name was not being saved to Google Sheets when call ended.

**Root Cause:** Same as BUG-1 - React state async updates. When `handleVapiCallEnd` was called, it read `workflow.warehouseManagerName` from state, but the state update hadn't been applied yet.

**Solution:**
1. Added `warehouseManagerNameRef` to `useDispatchWorkflow` hook
2. Synced ref with state in useEffect
3. Use `workflow.warehouseManagerNameRef.current` when saving to Google Sheets

**Files Modified:**
- `/hooks/useDispatchWorkflow.ts`
- `/app/dispatch/page.tsx`
- `/app/dispatch-2/page.tsx`

---

## Testing Lessons

### Validated Test Scenarios

**Test Scenario 1: Short Delay (30 mins)**
- Original: 2:00 PM, Delay: 30 mins → Arrival: 2:30 PM
- ✅ Strategy shows IDEAL: 2:30-3:00 PM
- ✅ Mike accepts offers between 2:30-3:00 PM immediately
- ✅ Mike rejects offers before 2:30 PM ("truck won't be there yet")
- ✅ Mike negotiates for earlier if offered after 4:30 PM

**Test Scenario 2: Medium Delay (90 mins)**
- Original: 2:00 PM, Delay: 90 mins → Arrival: 3:30 PM
- ✅ Strategy shows IDEAL: 3:30-4:00 PM
- ✅ Mike accepts 3:45 PM immediately (in IDEAL range)
- ✅ Mike accepts 5:00 PM after one pushback (in ACCEPTABLE range)
- ✅ Mike rejects 2:30 PM ("driver arrives at 3:30 PM")

**Test Scenario 3: Long Delay (180 mins)**
- Original: 2:00 PM, Delay: 180 mins → Arrival: 5:00 PM
- ✅ Strategy shows IDEAL: 5:00-5:30 PM
- ✅ Mike explains OTIF already missed, negotiates minimal dwell time
- ✅ Mike accepts 5:15 PM immediately
- ✅ Mike pushes back on 7:00 PM (2hr+ dwell time)

### Contract Analysis Performance

- **Extraction Time:** 30-40 seconds for 180KB PDF
- **Tokens Used:** ~25,000-30,000
- **Confidence:** HIGH (for well-structured contracts)

## VAPI Integration Lessons

### VAPI Events to Handle

| Event | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `call-start` | Call connected | Initialize state |
| `call-end` | Call ended | Trigger auto-save |
| `speech-start` | User started speaking | Cancel silence timer |
| `speech-end` | User stopped speaking | - |
| `transcript` | Speech transcribed | Only use `transcriptType === 'final'` |
| `message` | Assistant message | Check for closing phrases |
| `speech-update` | Assistant speech state | Track for graceful ending |

### Trap: VAPI model-output Events

**Problem:** `model-output` events look like duplicate messages.

**Reality:**
- These are VAPI internal events showing LLM generation, not final spoken output
- Slight variations ("we'll" vs "let's") are normal LLM streaming/candidate generation
- If duplicates were actually SPOKEN, that's a VAPI-side issue

**Solution:** Only log these events, don't process them. Use `transcript` with `transcriptType === 'final'` for actual messages.

### Dynamic Variables Passed to VAPI

```javascript
{
  // Core
  original_appointment: "2 PM",           // Speech format
  original_24h: "14:00",                  // 24h format
  delay_minutes: "90",
  shipment_value: "50000",

  // Arrival calculations
  actual_arrival_time: "3:30 PM",         // When truck physically arrives
  actual_arrival_24h: "15:30",            // Arrival in 24h format

  // OTIF window
  otif_window_start: "1:30 PM",
  otif_window_end: "2:30 PM",

  // HOS (when enabled)
  hos_enabled: "true",
  hos_remaining_drive: "6 hours 30 minutes",
  hos_remaining_window: "8 hours 15 minutes",
  hos_latest_dock_time: "8:00 PM",
  hos_binding_constraint: "14-hour window"
}
```

### User Action Required After VAPI Changes

After modifying VAPI-related code:
1. Copy `VAPI_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` content into VAPI dashboard
2. Navigate to: https://dashboard.vapi.ai → Assistants → Mike the Dispatcher → System Prompt

## React Patterns

### Pattern: useRef for Async Callback Values

**When to use `useRef` instead of `useState`:**
- Value is read inside async callbacks, event handlers, or closures
- Value changes frequently but doesn't need to trigger re-render
- You need synchronous access to the latest value

**Example from this codebase:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - useState closure captures stale value
const [pendingTime, setPendingTime] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Later in an async callback:
if (pendingTime) { // Always null due to closure!
  finishNegotiation(pendingTime, dock);
}

// ✅ CORRECT - useRef always has latest value
const pendingTimeRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

// Later in an async callback:
if (pendingTimeRef.current) { // Has the actual latest value
  finishNegotiation(pendingTimeRef.current, dock);
}
```

### Pattern: Sync State with Ref

When you need both reactive updates (for UI) and synchronous access (for callbacks):

```typescript
const [confirmedTime, setConfirmedTime] = useState<string | null>(null);
const confirmedTimeRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

// Keep ref in sync with state
useEffect(() => {
  confirmedTimeRef.current = confirmedTime;
}, [confirmedTime]);

// UI uses state (reactive)
<div>{confirmedTime}</div>

// Callbacks use ref (synchronous)
const handleCallEnd = () => {
  if (confirmedTimeRef.current) {
    saveToSheets(confirmedTimeRef.current);
  }
};
```

## Mobile Responsiveness Fixes

### SetupForm.tsx
- Changed grid from `grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- Form inputs stack on mobile, side-by-side on tablet+
- Fixed `col-span-2` to `sm:col-span-2` for delay slider and retailer selection

### StrategyPanel.tsx
- Changed from `grid-cols-3 text-[10px]` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 text-xs`
- Strategy cards stack vertically on mobile for better readability
- Increased font size from 10px to 12px (text-xs) for accessibility

### dispatch/page.tsx
- Changed header from `flex items-center justify-between` to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-start sm:items-center justify-between gap-3`
- Reduced horizontal padding from `px-6` to `px-4 sm:px-6` for better mobile margins
- Header elements stack on small screens, preventing overflow
