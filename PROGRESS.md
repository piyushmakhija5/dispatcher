## Current Work: Phase 10

### Hours of Service (HOS) Integration 🔄

**Goal:** Integrate FMCSA Hours of Service (49 CFR Part 395) constraints into dock rescheduling. Add **driver availability feasibility** as a new dimension alongside cost analysis.

**Problem Being Solved:**
- Dispatcher only considered **financial impact** when evaluating dock times
- Didn't consider whether driver can **legally** work at that time under HOS regulations
- Example: Driver has 2 hours remaining in 14-hour window, but warehouse offers 7 PM slot → system would evaluate cost only, not HOS feasibility

### Completed Sub-Phases

| Sub-Phase | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 10.1 | Types & HOS Engine | ✅ |
| 10.2 | Setup Form Updates | ✅ |
| 10.3 | Cost Engine & Strategy Integration | ✅ |
| 10.4 | Workflow Hook Integration | ✅ |
| 10.5 | UI Updates (StrategyPanel) | ✅ |
| 10.6 | API Webhook Updates | ✅ |
| 10.7 | Contract Analysis Updates | ✅ |
| 10.8 | Documentation Updates | ✅ |
| 10.9 | Testing & Validation | 🔄 |

### Files Created

**Types:**
```
/types/hos.ts (250 lines)
- DriverHOSStatus interface
- HOS_PRESETS (Fresh Shift, Mid-Shift, End of Shift)
- HOSFeasibilityResult, HOSBindingConstraint
```

**Engine:**
```
/lib/hos-engine.ts (400 lines)
- checkHOSFeasibility() - Check if dock time is feasible
- calculateLatestLegalDockTime() - Max time before HOS violation
- calculateNextShiftRequirement() - When next shift is needed
- estimateNextShiftCost() - Detention/layover costs
- calculateHOSStrategyConstraints() - Generate constraints for strategy
```

### Key Design Decisions

See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for full context.

1. **Simplified HOS Input Model**: Capture current state (remaining time) rather than full duty status timeline
2. **14-Hour Window is Critical**: Non-pausable constraint for dock scheduling
3. **HOS Presets**: Fresh Shift (11h/14h), Mid-Shift (6h/8h), End of Shift (2h/3h), Custom
4. **HOS as Ceiling**: HOS constraints cap cost-based thresholds

### HOS Strategy Integration

```typescript
// IDEAL cannot exceed HOS feasible time
thresholds.ideal.maxMinutes = Math.min(costBasedIdeal, hosConstraints.latestFeasibleTimeMinutes);

// ACCEPTABLE cannot exceed HOS feasible time
thresholds.acceptable.maxMinutes = Math.min(costBasedAcceptable, hosConstraints.latestFeasibleTimeMinutes);
```

### UI Mockup

```

### Remaining Work

**Test Scenarios Needed:**
- [ ] HOS enabled with Fresh Shift preset → full availability
- [ ] HOS enabled with End of Shift → limited availability, warnings shown
- [ ] Warehouse offers time beyond HOS → rejected with counter-offer
- [ ] Next shift required → detention cost calculated
- [ ] VAPI receives HOS variables correctly

**Manual Testing:**
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/dispatch` or `/dispatch-2`
3. Enable HOS in Setup Form
4. Select different presets
5. Verify Strategy Panel shows HOS constraints
6. Test voice call with HOS-constrained scenarios

### Phase 6: Negotiation Logic Fixes

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Phase 6 details</strong></summary>

**Issue Discovery**: Voice call testing revealed critical negotiation bugs where the dispatcher asks for appointment times BEFORE the truck can physically arrive.

#### Critical Bugs Identified (2026-01-20)

**Example Scenario**: 2 PM appointment + 90 min delay = 3:30 PM actual arrival
- ❌ Dispatcher asks for 2:30 PM slot (impossible - truck arrives at 3:30 PM!)
- ❌ Strategy cards show "IDEAL: Before 14:30" (before actual arrival)
- ❌ Confirmed time updates on extraction, not acceptance
- ❌ Counter-offers ask for earlier times even when already optimal

---

#### Fix 1: Calculate Actual Arrival Time ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem**: All calculations use `original_appointment` instead of `original_appointment + delay_minutes`

**Solution Implemented**: **Cost Curve Analysis Algorithm**

Instead of hardcoding assumptions about OTIF/dwell time, we now:
1. Calculate actual arrival time (`origMins + delayMinutes`)
2. Sample costs every 15 minutes for 6 hours after arrival
3. Analyze the cost curve to detect penalty structure:
   - Flat zones (no penalty increase)
   - Step jumps (sudden $100+ increases)
   - Linear growth (gradual increases)
4. Set thresholds dynamically based on detected structure

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/negotiation-strategy.ts` - Added `analyzeCostCurve()` function
- `/hooks/useCostCalculation.ts` - Returns `actualArrivalTime`
- `/components/dispatch/StrategyPanel.tsx` - Displays arrival time

**Test Results** (2 PM + 90 mins = 3:30 PM arrival, Walmart, $50K):
- ✅ **Truck arrives banner**: Shows 15:30 (3:30 PM)
- ✅ **IDEAL**: Around 15:30-16:00 (not 14:30!)
- ✅ **OK**: Before 17:15-17:30 (before step jump)
- ✅ **BAD**: After 17:30 (when dwell charges kick in)

**Key Achievement**: System is now truly GENERIC - works with any contract penalty structure without hardcoded assumptions.

---

#### Fix 3: Add Arrival Time to VAPI Dynamic Variables ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem**: VAPI assistant didn't know the actual arrival time, only delay minutes

**Solution**: Calculate and pass new variables to VAPI:
```javascript
{
  original_appointment: "2 PM",           // Speech format
  original_24h: "14:00",                  // 24h format
  actual_arrival_time: "3:30 PM",         // When truck physically arrives
  actual_arrival_24h: "15:30",            // Arrival in 24h format
  otif_window_start: "1:30 PM",           // OTIF window start
  otif_window_end: "2:30 PM",             // OTIF window end
  delay_minutes: "90",
  shipment_value: "50000",
  retailer: "Walmart"
}
```

**User Action Required**:
- [ ] Copy `VAPI_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` content into VAPI dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to: https://dashboard.vapi.ai → Assistants → Mike the Dispatcher → System Prompt

---

#### Fix 4: Only Update Confirmed Time on Acceptance ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem**: Voice mode updated `confirmedTime` when extracting warehouse offer, not when dispatcher accepts

**Solution**: Changed extraction logic to use local variables, only set confirmed state when `shouldAccept: true`

**Fixed Behavior**:
```
Warehouse: "6 PM"
→ Extraction: {offeredTime: '18:00'} (stored in local variable)
→ Evaluation: shouldPushback = true
→ Mike: "6 PM is too late for us..." (REJECT)
→ State: confirmedTime remains null ✅

Warehouse: "3:45 PM"
→ Extraction: {offeredTime: '15:45'} (stored in local variable)
→ Evaluation: shouldAccept = true
→ finishNegotiation('15:45', 'B5', ...)
→ State: setConfirmedTime('15:45') ✅ CORRECT
```

---

#### Fix 4B: Voice Call Auto-End Bug ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem**: Voice call did not end automatically after collecting all information

**Root Cause**: React state closure bug (see [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md#bug-1-react-state-closure-bug-voice-call-auto-end))

**Debug Logs Revealed**:
```
"Storing pending accepted time: 16:30 with cost: 1725" ✓
"⚠️ Got dock but no pending time! offeredDock: 1, pendingAcceptedTime: null" ✗
```

**Solution**: Changed from `useState` to `useRef`
- `useRef` updates synchronously - `ref.current` immediately reflects new value
- No closure issues - always reads latest value

---

#### Fix 4C: Graceful Call Ending with Silence Detection ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem**: Voice call ended immediately after Mike said closing phrase, not waiting for complete speech

**Solution**:
1. Track Assistant Speech State via `speech-update` event
2. Wait for Speech to Finish before starting silence timer
3. 5-second silence timer after speech completes
4. If user speaks during silence → timer cancelled, conversation continues

**Flow**:
```
1. Mike says closing phrase ("Alright, we'll see you then...")
2. System waits for Mike to finish speaking completely
3. 5-second silence timer starts
4. If user speaks during silence:
   → Timer cancelled
   → Mike addresses their query
   → Mike says new closing phrase
   → Back to step 2
5. If 5 seconds of silence pass:
   → Call ends gracefully
```

---

#### Fixes 5-6: Not Started

See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for planned validation layer and cost communication improvements.

#### Fixes 7-8: Skipped

- **Fix 7 (Counter-Offer Direction)**: Already addressed by Fix 1 (Cost Curve Analysis)
- **Fix 8 (Duplicate Response Prevention)**: VAPI internal LLM behavior, not our bug

### Phase 7: Dynamic Contract Analysis

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Phase 7 details</strong></summary>

**Goal**: Replace hardcoded contract rules with real-time LLM-based extraction from Google Drive documents.

#### Sub-Phase Summary

| Sub-Phase | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 7.1 | Architecture Design | ✅ |
| 7.2 | Google Drive Integration | ✅ |
| 7.3 | Contract Analysis with Claude | ✅ |
| 7.4 | Cost Engine Updates | ✅ |
| 7.5 | SetupForm Updates (remove retailer) | ✅ |
| 7.6 | Workflow Hook Integration | ✅ |
| 7.7 | UI Updates (ContractTermsDisplay) | ✅ |
| 7.8 | Testing & Validation | ✅ |

---

#### 7.1 Architecture Design

**Problem Identified**:
- Contract terms were hardcoded in `types/cost.ts` as `DEFAULT_CONTRACT_RULES`
- "Analyzing Contract Terms" step was UI theater - no actual document analysis
- Retailers hardcoded to 5 options (Walmart, Target, Amazon, Costco, Kroger)
- System couldn't adapt to different contract structures

**Design Decisions** (see [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)):
1. **Document Source**: Google Drive folder (service account auth)
2. **Document Selection**: Most recently modified file in folder
3. **Party Identification**: Extracted from contract (remove retailer dropdown)
4. **Analysis Timing**: Real-time on workflow trigger (no caching)
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with debug traces
6. **Schema**: Flexible structure with optional fields for unknown penalty types

**New Workflow Stages**:
```
setup → fetching_contract → analyzing_contract → computing_impact → negotiating → complete
```

---

#### 7.2 Google Drive Integration

**Architecture Decision**: Claude can process PDFs natively via the `document` content type in the API. No need for `pdf-parse` library.

**Files Created**:
- `/lib/google-drive.ts` - Google Drive service with:
  - `getClient()` - Service account authentication (internal)
  - `listFilesInFolder()` - List files sorted by modified time
  - `getFileContent()` - Returns base64 for PDFs, text for Google Docs
  - `fetchMostRecentContract()` - Main function to get latest contract
  - `checkDriveConnection()` - Health check function
- `/app/api/contract/fetch/route.ts` - API endpoint

**Response Format**:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  file: { id, name, mimeType, modifiedTime },
  contentType: 'pdf' | 'text',  // Tells Claude how to process
  content: string,              // base64 for PDF, plain text otherwise
  debug: { ... }
}
```

**Supported File Types**:
- PDF → returned as base64 (Claude processes directly)
- Google Docs → exported as plain text
- Plain text files → returned as-is

---

#### 7.3 Contract Analysis with Claude

**Files Created**:

1. **`/types/contract.ts`** (90 lines) - Type definitions
2. **`/lib/contract-analyzer.ts`** (410 lines) - Core analysis engine
3. **`/app/api/contract/analyze/route.ts`** (135 lines) - API endpoint

**Test Results** (Sample Transportation Agreement):

Successfully extracted:
- ✅ **3 Parties**: Shipper, Carrier, Consignee
- ✅ **2 Compliance Windows**: OTIF Pickup/Delivery (±30 min)
- ✅ **1 Delay Penalty**: Detention $75/hour after 120 min free time
- ✅ **8 Party Penalties**: Late Pickup/Delivery, Missed Appointment, etc.
- ✅ **8 Other Terms**: Layover, Stop-Off, Reconsignment, After-hours, etc.

**Performance**:
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5
- Tokens: 28,664
- Extraction Time: 38 seconds
- Confidence: HIGH

---

#### 7.4 Cost Engine Updates

**Conversion Functions** (`/lib/cost-engine.ts`):
- `convertExtractedTermsToRules()` - Transforms `ExtractedContractTerms` → `ContractRules`
- `convertDelayPenaltiesToDwellRules()` - Converts delay penalties
- `convertPartyPenaltiesToChargebacks()` - Converts party penalties
- `calculateTotalCostImpactWithTerms()` - Uses extracted terms

**Graceful Fallback Strategy**:
- No terms → Use `DEFAULT_CONTRACT_RULES` + log warning
- Missing dwell/detention → Use default dwell rules + warn
- Missing compliance windows → Use default 30-min OTIF window + warn
- Missing party penalties → Use default retailer chargebacks + warn
- Partial terms → Mix extracted + default values as needed

---

#### 7.5 SetupForm Updates

Removed the hardcoded retailer dropdown UI. All cost calculations now use 'Walmart' as fallback until contract-based party extraction provides the real value.

**Why 'Walmart' as Fallback?**:
- Most comprehensive penalty structure in `DEFAULT_CONTRACT_RULES`
- Conservative approach - won't under-estimate costs
- Replaced by actual extracted party name when contract analysis succeeds

---

#### 7.6 Workflow Hook Integration

**Updated Workflow Hook** (`/hooks/useDispatchWorkflow.ts`):
- Added new state variables: `extractedTerms`, `contractError`, `contractFileName`, `partyName`
- Completely rewrote `startAnalysis()` function with 3 phases:
  - **Phase 1**: Fetch contract from Google Drive
  - **Phase 2**: Analyze contract with Claude
  - **Phase 3**: Compute financial impact using extracted terms

**Graceful Degradation**:
- If contract fetch fails → Uses default contract rules + shows warning
- If contract analysis fails → Uses default contract rules + shows warning
- Console logs throughout for debugging

---

#### 7.7 UI Updates

**ContractTermsDisplay Component** (both UI variants):
- Collapsible panel showing extracted contract details
- Shows confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with color coding
- Displays parties, compliance windows, penalties, warnings

**StrategyPanel Updates**:
- Shows contract source indicator (✓ "Contract" or ⚠ "Defaults")
- Shows extracted party name when available

---

#### 7.8 Testing & Validation

**Test Scripts Created**:
1. `/tests/test-contract-flow.sh` - Basic contract analysis
2. `/tests/test-edge-cases.sh` - Edge case validation
3. `/tests/test-e2e-workflow.sh` - End-to-end workflow test
4. `/tests/test-cost-engine-with-terms.ts` - TypeScript unit tests

**Test Coverage**:
- [x] No document in folder → graceful error
- [x] Invalid folder ID → graceful error
- [x] Contract with unknown penalty types → captured in `otherTerms`
- [x] Contract missing sections → partial extraction with warnings
- [x] Different party names → correctly identified and used
- [x] End-to-end: fetch → analyze → negotiate flow

**Running Tests**:
```bash
./tests/test-contract-flow.sh      # Basic contract analysis
./tests/test-edge-cases.sh         # Edge cases and validation
./tests/test-e2e-workflow.sh       # Full end-to-end workflow
npx ts-node tests/test-cost-engine-with-terms.ts  # Unit tests
```

### Phase 8: UI Redesign & Modular Architecture

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Phase 8 details</strong></summary>

**Goal**: Create premium B2B UI with Carbon design system while ensuring business logic is modular and shared between UI variants.

---

#### 8.1 Carbon Theme Design System

**Design Philosophy**: "Confident Restraint" - Vercel/Stripe/GitHub inspired minimal dark theme

**Color Palette**:
- Base: `#0a0a0a` (true black) → Surface layers `#111111`, `#171717`, `#1f1f1f`
- Text: `#EDEDED` (primary) → `#888888` (secondary) → `#666666` (tertiary)
- Accent: `#0070F3` (clean blue), `#EDEDED` (white)
- Semantic: `#50E3C2` (success), `#F5A623` (warning), `#EE0000` (critical)

**Design Principles**:
- No gradients - solid colors only
- Minimal borders with subtle hover states
- Generous whitespace for premium feel
- Clean typography with Inter + JetBrains Mono
- Authority through restraint

**Files Created**:
- `/lib/themes/carbon.ts` - Complete Carbon color palette and component styles
- `/app/design-preview/page.tsx` - Design proposal comparison page
- `/app/design-preview/proposal-e/page.tsx` - Carbon dark theme ⭐ SELECTED

---

#### 8.2 Carbon-Styled Components

Created parallel component set with Carbon styling while maintaining identical functionality:

- `/components/dispatch-carbon/SetupForm.tsx`
- `/components/dispatch-carbon/ThinkingBlock.tsx`
- `/components/dispatch-carbon/StrategyPanel.tsx`
- `/components/dispatch-carbon/FinalAgreement.tsx`
- `/components/dispatch-carbon/ContractTermsDisplay.tsx`
- `/components/dispatch-carbon/index.ts`

**Key Achievement**: Same component interface, different visual presentation

---

#### 8.3 Dispatch-2 Page

- `/app/dispatch-2/page.tsx` - Full dispatch functionality with Carbon theme
  - Same hooks: `useDispatchWorkflow`, `useVapiCall`, `useAutoEndCall`
  - Same logic: VAPI integration, text mode, cost analysis
  - Same progressive disclosure: step-by-step reveals with loading states
  - Different: Carbon visual styling only

**Access**: http://localhost:3000/dispatch-2

---

#### 8.4 Modular Architecture Refactoring

**Problem**: Business logic was duplicated between `/dispatch` and `/dispatch-2`, causing:
- Bug fixes needed in two places
- Feature additions needed in two places
- Risk of inconsistency between pages

**Solution**: Extract all business logic into shared hooks and utilities

**Before vs After**:
```
Before Modularization:
/app/dispatch/page.tsx        ❌ Change here
/app/dispatch-2/page.tsx      ❌ AND here

After Modularization:
/lib/text-mode-handlers.ts    ✅ Change ONCE
Both pages automatically updated!
```

**Shared Hooks Created**:
- `/hooks/useProgressiveDisclosure.ts` (147 lines) - UI state machine
- `/hooks/useVapiIntegration.ts` (216 lines) - VAPI SDK lifecycle

**Shared Utilities Created**:
- `/lib/message-extractors.ts` (64 lines) - Parse time/dock from messages
- `/lib/text-mode-handlers.ts` (153 lines) - Conversation flow logic

**What's Shared (Single Source of Truth)**:
- ✅ VAPI call integration
- ✅ Message parsing (time/dock/name extraction)
- ✅ Cost calculation engine
- ✅ Negotiation strategy logic
- ✅ Text mode conversation flow
- ✅ Progressive disclosure state machine
- ✅ Backend API routes

**What's Different (UI Only)**:

### Phase 9: UI Enhancements

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Phase 9 details</strong></summary>

#### 9.1 Finalized Agreement Display ✅ COMPLETE (2026-01-24)

**Goal**: Show finalized agreement details after voice call ends to clearly communicate that the subagent completed its work.

**Implementation**:

Added a new "Agreement Finalized" section that appears after the "Spinning up Voice Subagent" section when a voice call ends successfully.

**State Management**:
- `showFinalizedAgreement` - Controls section visibility
- `finalizedHeaderComplete` - Tracks header typewriter completion
- `finalizedTypingComplete` - Tracks description typewriter completion
- `loadingFinalized` - Shows loading spinner during transition

**Progressive Disclosure Flow**:
1. Voice call ends (callStatus === 'ended')
2. System checks for confirmed time and dock
3. 1-second loading spinner appears
4. "Agreement Finalized" section reveals
5. Header animates with typewriter effect
6. Description animates with typewriter effect
7. Details card appears showing all confirmed information

**Information Displayed**:
- Original Time - Initial appointment time from setup
- Driver Delay - Delay in minutes (highlighted in amber/warning color)
- New Arrival Time - Calculated actual arrival time (original + delay)
- New Confirmed Time - Rescheduled appointment time (highlighted in green/success color)
- Dock Number - Confirmed dock assignment (highlighted in green/success color)
- Warehouse Contact - Name of warehouse manager (if captured)
- Total Cost Impact - Financial impact with cost breakdown (highlighted in amber/warning color)

**Visual Design**:
- **Original Theme** (`/dispatch`): Emerald green success styling with slate details card
- **Carbon Theme** (`/dispatch-2`): Carbon success colors with minimal aesthetic

#### 9.2 Bug Fix: Warehouse Contact Not Saving to Sheets ✅ COMPLETE (2026-01-24)

**Issue**: Warehouse manager name was not being saved to Google Sheets when call ended.

**Root Cause**: React state async updates (see [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md#bug-5-warehouse-contact-not-saving-to-sheets))

**Fix**:
1. Added `warehouseManagerNameRef` to `useDispatchWorkflow` hook
2. Synced ref with state in useEffect
3. Use `workflow.warehouseManagerNameRef.current` when saving to Google Sheets

**Result**: Warehouse contact name now correctly saves to Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ~~Duplicate Logic~~ | ✅ Fixed | Merged into shared libraries |
| API Keys Exposed | ⚠️ | Rotate after migration |
| ~~VAPI SDK SSR~~ | ✅ Fixed | Dynamic import solution |
| ~~No Tests~~ | ✅ Fixed | Comprehensive tests in `/tests/` |
| ~~Hardcoded Contracts~~ | ✅ Fixed | LLM extraction (Phase 7) |
| ~~Hardcoded Retailers~~ | ✅ Fixed | Dynamic party extraction |

## Notes

- Keep original folders intact until migration verified working
- Test each phase before proceeding
- Commit after each completed phase
- Build verified working after Phase 4: `npm run build` passes
- Components use TypeScript with proper types from `/types/`
- Hooks extract complex logic from page component
- VAPI SDK dynamically imported to avoid SSR issues
- See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for architectural decisions and traps to avoid
